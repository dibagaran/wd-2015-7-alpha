            It is a great adventure to contemplate the universe, beyond man,
            to contemplate what it would be like without man, as it was in a great
            part of its long history and as it is in a great majority of places. When
            this objective view is finally attained, and the mystery and majesty of
            matter are fully appreciated, to then turn the objective eye back on man
            viewed as matter, to view life as part of this universal mystery of greatest
            depth, is to sense an experience which is very rare, and very exciting.
            It usually ends in laughter and a delight in the futility of trying to
            understand what this atom in the universe is, this thing - atoms with
            curiosity - that looks at itself and wonders why it wonders. Well, these
            scientific views end in awe and mystery, lost at the edge in uncertainty,
            but they appear to be so deep and so impressive that the theory that it is all
            arranged as a stage for God to watch man's struggle for good and evil seems inadequate.
